Version control is a system that tracks changes to code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase while keeping a complete history of all changes. This means developers can go back to earlier versions if something breaks or compare what has changed. One major benefit of version control is that it helps teams avoid overwriting each other’s work and makes it easier to manage collaboration, especially in large projects.

For example, in a software development team, each developer might work on a different feature in a separate branch using Git. Once a feature is ready, they use version control to merge it into the main codebase after review and testing. This keeps the code organized, reduces errors, and helps teams deploy faster.


A commonly used Git command is: git commit -m "Add login functionality" 

This command saves a snapshot of code with a message describing the change.

Version control is an essential tool for professional developers and teams to work safely and efficiently.
